## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
1. Nearest E-Waste Collection and Recycling Facility Locator
Front-End:
Use HTML/CSS for the structure and styling.
Use JavaScript for dynamic functionality.
Integrate a map API like Google Maps API to show locations.
Provide a search bar for users to enter their location.
Back-End:
Use a server-side language (like Node.js, Python, or PHP) to handle requests.
Use a database (like MySQL, MongoDB) to store e-waste facility locations.

2. Educational Pop-Ups on Harmful Components
Use modal pop-ups triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicking on a specific component name).
Use JavaScript to display pop-up content dynamically.

3. Input Device Model and Earn Credit Points
Provide a form where users can input their device model.
Calculate the credit points based on the precious metals in the device.

## Use Cases

This simple solution provides the basic structure for the e-waste collection and recycling facility locator, educational pop-ups, and device model input with credit points. You can expand on these basics by adding more detailed styling, better error handling, and more advanced features as needed.
